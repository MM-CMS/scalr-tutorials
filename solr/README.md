Scalr Solr Tutorial
===================

This tutorial deploys Solr on infrastructure managed by Scalr. 

The test data is a list of Cities, and can be searched using Solr once it is
deployed.

Note that the support files are available on Github, but retrieved via S3 as
Github does not allow retrieving large blobs.
